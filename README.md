# Hexcellent System
At the start of the semester (August 2021) the group aims were to create a health device that logged user data and on which the user could view their data. 
The data was to include the users hydration, calorie and vitals data. Due to hardware compatibility issues, the display of the vitals data was unsuccessful. 
The other data are displayed in the app as graphs per week.
All URLs have been replaced with "???" to protect the database used in the project.
